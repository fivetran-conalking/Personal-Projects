After you've subscribed to a webhook, you can let your app execute code immediately after specific <a href=\"#events-\">events</a> occur in shops that have your app installed, instead of having to make API calls periodically to check their status. For example, you can rely on webhooks to trigger an action in your app when a customer creates a cart, or when a merchant creates a new product in their Shopify admin. By using webhooks subscriptions you can make fewer API calls overall, which makes sure that your apps are more efficient and update quickly.</p> <h3>Anatomy of a webhook</h3> <p>After you <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/api/getting-started/webhooks#configure-webhook\">configure a webhook subscription</a>, the events that you specified will trigger a webhook notification each time they occur. This notification contains a JSON payload, and HTTP headers that provide context. For example, the <code>orders/create</code> webhook includes the following headers:</p> <p> <ul> <li><strong>X-Shopify-Topic:</strong> <code>orders/create</code></li> <li><strong>X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256:</strong> <code>XWmrwMey6OsLMeiZKwP4FppHH3cmAiiJJAweH5Jo4bM=</code> </li> <li><strong>X-Shopify-Shop-Domain:</strong> <code>johns-apparel.myshopify.com</code></li> <li><strong>X-Shopify-API-Version:</strong> <code>2019-04</code></li> </ul> </p> <p>Some HTTP headers are particularly useful for your app. For example, <code>X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256</code> is used to <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/api/getting-started/webhooks#verify-webhook\">verify webhooks</a>, and <code>X-Shopify-Shop-Domain</code> is used to identify the store that's associated with them.</p> <p><code>X-Shopify-API-Version</code> is used to confirm what version of the Admin API used to serialize the webhook event payload. You can <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/api/versioning/webhooks\">configure your app</a> to use a specific API version for all webhooks and that version will be used whenever possible. If an app is set to use an API version that is no longer supported, then Shopify will fall forward to use the oldest supported version.</p> <p>Webhook subscriptions are scoped only to the app that they're registered to. This means that when a webhook subscription is registered to an app, other apps can't view, modify, or delete it. For more information about how to authenticate webhooks, see <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/api/tutorials/webhooks\"><i>Using webhooks</i></a>. For general information about authentication, see the <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/api/guides/authentication\">OAuth documentation</a>.</p> <h3>List of supported webhook events and topics</h3> <p>You can retrieve data in either JSON or XML format.

For example, if your app is a marketplace channel, then you can use resource feedback to alert merchants that they need to connect their marketplace account by signing in.</p> <p>Resource feedback notifications are displayed to the merchant on the home screen of their Shopify admin, and in the product details view for any products that are published to your app.</p> <p>This resource should be used only in cases where you're describing steps that a merchant is required to complete. If your app offers optional or promotional set-up steps, or if it makes recommendations, then don't use resource feedback to let merchants know about them.</p> <h2>Sending feedback on a shop</h2> <p>You can send resource feedback on a shop to let the merchant know what steps they need to take to make sure that your app is set up correctly. Feedback can have one of two states: <code>requires_action</code> or <code>success</code>. You need to send a <code>requires_action</code> feedback request for each step that the merchant is required to complete.</p> <p>If there are multiple set-up steps that require merchant action, then send feedback with a state of <code>requires_action</code> as merchants complete prior steps. And to remove the feedback message from the Shopify admin, send a <code>success</code> feedback request.</p> <div class=\"note\"> <h4>Important</h4> <p>Sending feedback replaces previously sent feedback for the Shop.

The string must be a single message up to 100 characters long, must follow your app's name with <code>[is/has]</code>, and must end with a period.

Some common carrier services include Canada Post, FedEx, UPS, and USPS. The term <strong>carrier</strong> is often used interchangeably with the terms <strong>shipping company</strong> and <strong>rate provider</strong>.</p> <p>Using the CarrierService resource, you can add a carrier service to a shop and then provide a list of applicable shipping rates at checkout. You can even use the cart data to adjust shipping rates and offer shipping discounts based on what is in the customer's cart.</p> <h2>Requirements for accessing the CarrierService resource</h2> <p>To access the CarrierService resource, add the <code>write_shipping</code> permission to your app's requested scopes. For more information, see <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/api/getting-started/authentication/oauth/scopes\"><em>API access scopes</em></a>.</p> <p>Your app's request to create a carrier service will fail unless the store installing your carrier service meets one of the following requirements: <ul> <li>It is on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher.</li> <li>Its Shopify plan is paid annually.</li> <li>It is a development store.</li> </ul> </p> <aside class=\"note\"> <h4>Note</h4> <p>If a store changes its Shopify plan, then the store's association with a carrier service is deactivated if the store no long meets one of the requirements above. </p> </aside> <h2>Providing shipping rates to Shopify</h2> <p>When adding a carrier service to a store, you need to provide a POST endpoint rooted in the <code>callback_url</code> property where Shopify can retrieve applicable shipping rates.
