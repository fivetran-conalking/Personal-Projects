In the middle of watch a show it freezes up and then exit the entire app altogether. Also, when back in if you fast forward to the part where you left off it does not play... A) It either freezes up again or B) Exit the app. This is becoming beyond frustrating.\",\r\n                \"Great content but it's there are some things here and there that lessen the experience.

I run into issues every time I use it. I only pay for ESPN + and I only care about boxing. But every time I try to cast to the TV, ESPN tries to play whatever is auto playing on the home page. And when I do manage to successfully cast what I actually want to watch, it will freeze for a few seconds every 30 seconds. I can't believe they raised the price two dollars. I'm seriously considering cancelling my subscription. Fix it.\",\r\n                \"So works fine when I'm not casting, but when I go to cast, it often has an error and won't cast. I have it in 2 different devices. One will never cast what I want, the other will usually after three tries. Sometimes it wants to cast another video altogether from the one that in trying to cast. Since the whole purpose of having the app is to cast usl and mls soccer into my TV, this makes the app close to useless, despite having to pay money every month for it.\",\r\n                \"Very slow and clunky to use. Video doesn't play at all. Notifications randomly disappear, after being selected. It uses way more battery than it should. It seems like it should be easy to move games that have been selected for notifications to the top into the favorites section, rather than having favorite teams. The scores are very much behind. I could get score updates faster from a teletype machine back in 1992. This is one of the worst sports apps out there for Android.\",\r\n                \"Utterly useless. Cluttered beyond belief. Many of the sports events I want come up with unable to load errors constantly but come through just fine from the cable provider.

The app says that everything has been delivered while in actuality only half of the items made it. The tracking on where the items currently located is VERY broad, so it's kind of bad. The benefit of the doubt I'll give them is that they update the tracker overtime. Overall, it's just not very good at tracking in layman's terms.\",\r\n                \"This app sucks, it seems very dodgy, it doesn't give you the tracking of your recent order, it only gives you the order that was delivered long ago, NOT the present order that I did just a day ago, but say's to enter the tracking number, which doesn't exist, so what good is that, I would not recommend this app it's too risky and dodgy.\",\r\n                \"I really like this app, most of my purchases come up on here, the only thing I wish is that it could update when something is delivered.. it hasn't been able to do that for any of my orders so far, I always have to manual change the status for when I actually recieve it.

Always something to find when I get tired of scrolling through the other apps. Yes there's ads,and they can be repetitive however no where near as bad as cable. Small price to pay for free tv imo.\",\r\n                \"I had a three star for this app, but now it is one star. They claim \\\"less ads,\\\" but I'm not seeing any change.

I'm also unsure how Pluto has a 4.1 rating when the reviews and the app performance seems to say 2.9. The app needs fixed. Ads every five minutes is ridiculous too. Try Tubi. It's free. Not as many ads.\",\r\n                \"I was quite disappointed after the last update 3 days ago.

Not only is there not a 10 second forward and rewind but not I can't see how many ads are going to play. Please put the format back to what it was, it was so much better than it is now.

When you click the show code, it show you the accounts that you look it into and the code is pop up on down of that accounts. When you need to update the backup, please sign in to update the backup. Because the backup did not update and you will lost some of the accounts. Not all of the accounts will be lose. When you reinstalling the app, please click begin recovering because when you sign in back from Microsoft. you see warning! Do you want to overwrite with the backup? If you try to sign in back in the recover your 2 step-verification, you need to use password to sign in, use other second verification option that set up and recover your accounts.

I really wanted to use it on ChromeOS if I lose my phone since I've 2FA enabled on all my accounts. This app just doesn't support ChromeOS. It'll install but it's has so many security requirements based on Android. IF you sign in it'll hang trying to talk to the android system if it has screen lock, which doesn't work because it doesn't detect the ChromeOS lock. Meaning it'll let you login and see your passwords but disables 2FA and you're more likely to delete your backup because it doesn't ask to restore your old one. So by that point if you try hard enough you've deleted all your backed up OTP codes and can't add new ones. For a feature request, I'd like to ask for either better integration with chromeOS or an advanced settings page to disable those checks if your comfortable with it.\",\r\n                \"I just have a few suggestions for improvement (all stem from using the \\\"Authenticator Pro\\\" app prior to using this app): 1) Allow the user to set a timeout period after which the app will lock once it leaves the screen (instead of the default, which is immediately) 2) Add A Lot more icons and give the user an option to edit the icons of the individual entries. 3) Find a way for the user to add both Steam and Blizzard Authenticators. 4) Get rid of the red dot on the 3 dots menu button.

Last time I had to wait for 40 mins. before the driver bothered to cancel and assign a new driver. There was no way where I could contact the Customer Care and get a new ride. Uber has become extremely unprofessional.\",\r\n                \"This app was the best some months back, but nowadays its hardly any helpful. I used to recommend this to everyone, but not anymore. The drivers aren't good anymore, infact they are more demanding than ever. If only Uber introduces some rules that restrict drivers to cancel the ride based on their mood or requirements. It's very annoying when the drivers call just to ask the drop location and cancel the ride. And this has happened not once, not twice but a dozen times. It's pathetic.\",\r\n                \"It used to be a good app but now I have to wait up to 30 mins for my ride and even then I still have to wait more time on them which results in me not being on time.

Run!😎lol\",\r\n                \"Hi Google translate I am quite satisfied with the app, But during English to Punjabi translation I face grammer, word selection, semantical and correctness problems using this app. Also voice recognition system for Punjabi is also not available in this app. I have also seen the lacks of synonyms for Punjabi in the app. Recently Canada also recognize Punjabi as 3rd official language. That's why I hope this problem will be solved in the next first or second app update. Thanks and regards.\",\r\n                \"The audio input won't stay on long enough to listen to the entire sentence.

The audio input stops after 1-1.5 seconds into recording me and then the app translates only a portion of what I meant to say and after trying 5 times, you just want to smash the phone.

Now it won't cast any stream to my TV through a Chromecast (although it will play live TV). This is ridiculous because the CBS app did the same thing to me while being acquired by Paramount. I've paid premium price for an app that has not worked for 6 of the past 14 months! I don't want to watch shows on my phone, I have a 60 inch TV for that. All my other streaming services work fine. Paramount this needs to be fixed! I've rebooted my wifi, and my Chromecast.\",\r\n                \"Not sure what touch-ups you made, but it definitely wasn't an improvement. I pay to use this app and constantly have trouble with either it not opening or it freezes; just like CBS app. (Most of my free apps get better service.) Plus, too many updates. I had to update September 9, and here it is 12:22 am on September 28 and I had to update again, and still problems with it. The furthest I get is to select a program and then get a blank screen.\",\r\n                \"When it works it's great, but doesn't work often. I was watching a show and it kicked me out (no one else is on it) then now the app will just say retry constantly even after all the steps people suggest. It also acts like the show doesn't exist or it does and it says error. Have never had a problem with any of my apps like this one.... Isn't even the internet just the app. Great amount of shows but what's the point if you can't watch them!\",\r\n                \"The android app is fine, not that I use it much but the app for my LG TV needs A LOT of work.

If you go to a specific show and then to the episodes list you have no idea where you left off.

And the quality went way down from the previously-free and no-subscription-required Google Hangouts (which did retain the chat history of meetings).

Not sure these are the first things you would find useful, meeting someone for the first time. Also, I'm surprised there's no sounding alphabet in the introduction. Think it's important for pronunciation.\",\r\n                \"Its the best app to learn any new language from.

The Owl mascot, Duo, is also very encouraging and on the whole it is loaded with great features and it really drives you to learn. You actually feel addicted to it. To top it all, it's a free app. Kudos to the team at Duolingo for enriching people's lives in such a wonderful way, and for making quality education free for all. 😃\",\r\n                \"The language learning side is great - lots of features, useful forums and free. I don't even mind that the ads become longer the further I progress through lessons. But the league tables are hideous.

It's super easy to use, ads aren't intrusive, its cute and makes it fun to learn. I've tried a few other language apps that claimed to have a \\\"free\\\" version. Duolingo is the only one that offers a free version that you can continue to learn instead of just repeating the first lesson. I'm happy to continue watching ads if it means I can keep learning for free until I get back to a steady paying job.

Along with picture flash cards, it has you write AND speak the words in both your language and the new one. It also makes you translate back and forth between them.

I frequently get gift cards and add them to the app; however, when one card empties it is awkward to switch to another. It often happens in the middle of a purchase I am making. This needs to be changed so that when a gift card is added, it boost the total of account. Chick-fil-a has figured this out and it works great on their app. Please, please, please fix the way your app works.\",\r\n                \"So I love the app. The drive-thru lines have been so long in my area that the secret is definitely to order online and walk in. It feels weird to bypass all the lines but it's easy peasy. Big suggestion for the app though, I would like to be able to place an order for the future. Meaning, I'm ready to place my order now but I won't be picking up for 15 minutes, they should have that feature.\",\r\n                \"The concepts of the app are great. However, in execution the app functions below expected standards. Example: order suddenly disappears and app closes, remake order, and app adds 2 to quantity. Try to change quantity, and app doesnt load the simple change in a timely manner. I could imagine it costing you $$$, i just bought an energy drink instead of the order that would've been placed. Work on your app a little bit more.\",\r\n                \"Does not work. Kept freezing. Finally got it to work after 10 minutes of frustration only to be told I had to purchase a gift card to pay...then when I went to check out it would only let me use a credit card and not the gift card I had just purchased! Now I downloaded it on my husband's phone and the same issues occured and it keeps freezing.\",\r\n                \"App does not even check to see if the Dunkin that you are picking up at has all items in your order before making charging your card. In this case, it was the most expensive item in the order. I canceled the order at the Dunkin. And I called customer service to be certain that the charge would be backed off of the card. However, I was informed that it will be 4 to 8 business days before the charge will backed off.

The music slows way down then back to speed over and over throughout every song. It's so bad I'd rather listen to a dripping water faucet than this. I have updated the app with no change sure hope there is a fix before I start using iheart radio app and delete Pandora. Which will be soon!! I need my music!!!🤞\",\r\n                \"It sucks, anytime I thumb down a song it comes back after 3 songs later. When I add a new station all of the other genres I liked come to the new station and ruin the experience. Anytime I get an ad there is not 1, but 2 in a row. As well as sometime my music just suddenly stops playing at random times and I have to go back to the app and start my station again. And the same thing happens sometimes when I turn off my phone. Over all Pandora is terrible. Don't recommend. Get soundcloud instead.\",\r\n                \"Like this app that despite it having to pay for premium every month the app is free for download and offers different varieties of music abilities to create music stations and being able to explore on a journey through different playlists of different genres of different artists of music.

I'm still an avid supporter of Affirm. Love Affirm! I have used affirm for several purchases and I love it! I have not had any issues and I've used them for about two years now. Thanks to affirm, I got a new blender, vacuum, and a few other things at affordable monthly prices. With no penalty to pay off early I typically pay off within three to six months. I am very pleased with Affirm!\",\r\n                \"I was shopping on Amazon through the app. I was purchasing items for baby shower I could not attend. The 5 items I purchase I thought everything was ok when I connect my debit card to the account. I made the 1st payment and thought all 5 items were paid for. Well only 1 item shipped. Amazon ask to update payment for the rest of the items. You would think that Affirm paid for all items in full and you pay them with installments. I don't think I will use again. I will stick with Afterpay!\",\r\n                \"I checked it out because i heard walmart is doing away with lay-away and switching to this. Well people who use lay-away have bad or no credit, its the reason they use the service in the first place, if they had average credit they would have a credit card and wouldnt need it or a service like this... But unlike lay-away you need a 620 or more credit score to use this. I guess the poorer folk can kiss this christmas goodbye\",\r\n                \"I love this app!

I used to stream on Twitch but today I am completly quiting the platform as I don't want to abuse my viewers or be abused by Twitch when trying to have a chill moment with the streamers I know.

The interface is easily tailored to you likings, and easy to use. It's simple in a utilitarian way. I have since discovered many books that I would otherwise not have read. I listen to (read) a lot of philosophy books and I really enjoy the clip/bookmark feature. When I find a passage that really speaks to me I can flag it for future examination, and so I don't forget it. In the 1/2 month I've already used up my 2 free books and want more.\",\r\n                \"Love this app!!! There is always a great book waiting to be read and between the 2 for 1 sales, free originals and Monthly credits, I always have enough books, or credits to get anything I want. This is one subscription that I can honestly say, is worth every penny (and it mostly pays for itself anyway). If I don't like a book, I can exchange it, and when I'm done, I can pass my books on to my friends or keep them in my library indefinitely, just like reg. books. Amazing App Amazon!!!\",\r\n                \"Audible is amazing! I used to love reading (still do) but don't have the time for it anymore as a working mom. Audible lets me listen to my books while I'm doing house chores like laundry or dishes and still enjoy my books. My only complaint would be the syncing between devices. I can listen on my phone one day, ask my echo to play it another day, and there isn't any continuity between the two. My only complaint though :)\",\r\n                \"Although I have had a couple of issues trying to purchase new books, customer service is very helpful and talked me through the issue.

Seriously, I want to give them the big middle finger because I have cancelled and rearranged plans based on their prediction and wasted so many days not going and doing things because of their false prediction of rain. 2 days ago they said rain from 5am-3pm. It was dry 5am-3pm and rain started at 3. Can their predictions get any worse??\",\r\n                \"Used this app for many years and it has worked great. Past few weeks however, not so much. Super glitchy; radar map takes several minutes to update and show any activity. Hourly activity has lower accuracy rate compared to other weather apps. To top it off, the ads have become unbearable. Every time I click somewhere I get an ad. And no, I will not get a premium sub to take the ads off. I've uninstalled the app and am not going to look back.\",\r\n                \"The app has always been pretty ok. I have an ad blocker on my phone, so ads haven't bothered me as they have others but, as of a week or 2 ago, it just won't work at all. Sticks at the initial load screen saying, \\\"still waiting on server...\\\", then eventually, \\\"app failed to start, please try again later\\\". I did, 3 times over 1 day, always this. Weather Underground app seems to work fine, so I'm sticking with that just now.\",\r\n                \"Much preferred the Storm radar app. The radar played a longer loop and it told me the weather. That's it. That's all I want in a weather app. I don't need or want my WEATHER app to tell me what the CDC says, if I cared about that I'd look for a CDC app. I wanted a WEATHER app. All I care about is if it will rain, how warm it will be what does the future forecast hold. Anything else is useless garbage as far as I am concerned.\",\r\n                \"Really like this app. I've tried literally dozens of weather apps and for me, this is the best so far.

Instead of getting help i was accused of trying to play from out of state and locked out of my account for 24 hours. Thanks but no thanks Used to work fine. The last couple weeks now it keeps telling me I am not in a valid state, even tho I never leave illinois, and I can only place a bet maybe 25% of the times I try. Either because it says I'm in an invalid state or because I get locked out for trying again too many times.\",\r\n                \"So basically the app will offer you promotions that you are eligible for then not show you have completed the proper steps witch you have, opting in placing the bet ect.. so when you go to talk to someone about it with their pics poor chat system that takes 30+ minutes to even get someone they auto login-off you from your account kicking you out of line in chat.

Whether I'm using ibis for work or leisure, the lagging and crashing caused by these ads, takes me out of my element. Ibis is one of the best in the game, but don't screw it up. Please fix this.\",\r\n                \"First, let me say this was hands down the best art app I have found. Using a Note 20 Ultra, I see none of the lag or crashes that other reviews talk about. The banner ads are just minor annoyances. The problem is the outrageous subscription fee for premium brushes. I can watch a 30 second ad to unlock them for a day. How is 30 seconds a day worth $8.99/month? In what world is that a reasonable price? There are other apps now that can accomplish the same results for free. I just watch the ad.\",\r\n                \"It glitches all the time :[ ! I can barely do anything on it, uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't do anything anymore. I know it's not my phone glitching, I've seen plenty of other reviews complaining about this and every other app runs fine. Everything else is good like the way the app is set up and the variety of brushes, but that's all useless when the app can't run.\",\r\n                \"I will really appreciate this app for some things. It is very easy to use and so smooth. It also doesn't show any ads unless you want to unlock premium brushes. Very simple but helpful app for digital drawing. It's also lightweight. I can also draw from reference by importing picture there. For line art, smudge drawing, manga drawing and any kind of digital drawing can be done here. I strongly recommend this for using to all the digital artists.\",\r\n                \"I love this app, but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because, it's a bit confusing to use (e.g. brushes, colours, layers, ect.) When ever I put a tool to it's thickest, it glitches and I have to switch my device of and on to reboot. Over all the app is pretty cool. There aren't adds and you can unlock everything for 18 hours by watching a video! Unlike most drawing apps, it lets you press undo endless amounts of times in a row.

The only problem I have with that is it had happened several months in a row and each time the victim had alerted Airbnb to the situation but they had done nothing to ensure this profile was deleted.\",\r\n                \"The app is great. The only problem I have is with Airbnb themselves. We had to cancel earlier than we wanted to because of the death of my father in law.

We had to leave early to drive from Kansas City MO back to Ohio to make arrangements.

If you don't, I'll keep being pissed off and switch to the CVS that is actually closer. My loyalty lasts so long\",\r\n                \"I am satisfied with the app. The coupons on the app is my issue. It takes 6 sec before you can add another or even scroll. Its been like this and is very aggravating, especially when there are hundreds to go through. I get frustrated and close out. Whoever is in charge of that part should rework the coupon loading timer.(No other app I have does this. I can add coupons in 1 to 2 sec w no delay.)It makes me want to not shop there and sometimes I don't just because of coupon loading aggravation.\",\r\n                \"This last update is terrible. Tells me things are getting filled when they aren't. Also things don't clear out when I pick them up. Still says they are filled. Also some just don't show up that they are getting filled or ready to be picked up. I am probably leaving something out. Should go back to the last style before this newer style. The old one worked great! Easy to use and easy to understand. The new can get a bit confusing. Not nearly efficient as the last\",\r\n                \"UPDATE: this app has gotten so much worse in the last few months! It is almost never correct and no longer pushes messages to my phone after I have set it and reset it and so has Walgreens. I accidentally ordered a refill for the wrong rx, so I cancelled it 15 minutes after ordered. Walgreens filled it anyway. I told them I had cancelled it and they said no problem, we'll put it back. They keep refilling it! 3 times, but I can't get the rx I need filled. Going to CVS.\",\r\n                \"This app's terrible. It lists prescriptions to fill, then sends a message that a prescription is too early to fill. Why did you put it on the list of meds to be refilled if it wasn't ready to fill? They sent me a text to contact my provider to get a prescription filled. I called the provider, they authorized the refill, but Walgreens didn't notified me that the situation had been resolved. All this is poor program design. Please get someone who knows what they're doing to rewright the program.\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"editorsChoice\": false,\r\n            \"features\": [],\r\n            \"appId\": \"com.usablenet.mobile.walgreen\",\r\n            \"url\": \"http://gplayapi.herokuapp.com/api/apps/com.usablenet.mobile.walgreen\",\r\n            \"playstoreUrl\": \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usablenet.mobile.walgreen&hl=en&gl=us\",\r\n            \"permissions\": \"http://gplayapi.herokuapp.com/api/apps/com.usablenet.mobile.walgreen/permissions\",\r\n            \"similar\": \"http://gplayapi.herokuapp.com/api/apps/com.usablenet.mobile.walgreen/similar\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"title\": \"Brave Private Browser: Secure, free web browser\",\r\n            \"description\": \"Privately browse the internet, for free!

Went through the entire process of creating a listing only to get to the final page with all the ridiculous fees. The whole point of doing local is to save money and hassles with shipping, etc. No thanks, I'd rather stick to Facebook Marketplace or eBay with local pick up. I tried selling something for 70 bucks and if I was lucky I would get 60. Hard pass. Nice looking app but the fees aren't worth it.\",\r\n                \"No stars!!! Everytime I think this app can't get any worse it does. If a seller accidentally sends my package to the wrong address and it comes back to them, then they have to relist it and I have to repay after I already paid the first time. This system is seriously broken. There is an automated customer service system which is frustrating when you need to talk to a human being. This app used to allow me the option of shipping the item myself and now it won't. This app is trash.\",\r\n                \"Overall, the app is a good idea for those who do not want to use another marketplace like app. Personal issue is with the charge Mercari takes off your items when you place them in your store; no gimmick they tell you the fees they charge. $14 item, earned $11.89. Sure, this is the way to keep the app working and functional to the extent that is needed but there is not much money to be made here if you are looking for quick, fast cash selling items you don't want anymore. Explore your options.\",\r\n                \"Customer service is automated and automatically shuts off at 1 min of recording. Thus doesn't allow you to make offers if you are on vacation, even if you are sending it to a US address. The automated messages will sometimes apply and sometimes not. If you ship an item and it will still send you reminders to ship even if you already have. A lot of technical issues, but the app is a great idea. It just needs a lot more technical support and improved customer relations.\",\r\n                \"Great App for buying used (and some new) clothes at a fair price if you hunt around. Selling, to me is a hassle, and a lot of time for little money, but that may just be because I am VERY thorough with my listing and descriptions. But I find people don't even want to pay $12 for New WITH TAGS, Nice PLUS SIZE, Name Brand Clothing. 5 Stars for Buying 3 Stars for Selling\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"editorsChoice\":

For starters, it is VERY slow. You will often need to close and restart the app multiple times just to get episodes to load. Furthermore, the downloading function is broken. It is SIGNIFICANTLY slower than it should be and downloads will often cancel on their own. I've been a subscriber for 2 years now and might just have to unsubcribe until the app is fixed.\",\r\n                \"I don't know if it's me or not but I can get into the Funimation app but it won't load anything. Any time I open the app it says: \\\"unable to load at this time. Please try again later.\\\" Even though I have waited 2-3 days between using or opening the app and have uninstalled and reinstalled it to try and fix it. It unfortunately didn't work. I love the app itself but I can't give it a better review until I can actually watch something.\",\r\n                \"You guys are doing better with the app, it no longer repeats the anime list over and over. Thanks for fixing that. When clicking the back arrow you still have to drag down to load the anime in your queue, that causes the list to start over from the beginning. I also wanna note that i was watching an anime that doesnt seem to have the entire episode, so it cuts off the the last few minutes and closing credits.\",\r\n                \"App has several issues for year's. Currently nothing loads in my home screen except for the top banner of highlighted content. A constant issue is that videos do not save the correct stop point, and there is a periodic issue of no skip forward to the next episode button. You have to quit the video, search for the show, then find the next episode. Developers do not seem motivated to fix the app; 3 years, same issues, currently 100% broken. Funimation is excellent for Xbox and PC, not for Android\",\r\n                \"The app is basically broken for anyone who prefers the sub.

If a user cannot sign, he/she can simply type a word in English, and automatically the word will be spelled for the user.<br><br>•\\tIt already contains a list of approximately 3000 words and a larger database of lexical entries is in the process of being added.\",\n            \"summary\": \"Meghalaya Sign is Language shared across the deaf communities in Meghalaya.\",\n            \"installs\": \"1,000+\",\n            \"minInstalls\": 1000,\n            \"maxInstalls\": 1490,\n            \"score\": 4.8333335,\n            \"scoreText\": \"4.8\",\n            \"ratings\": 30,\n            \"reviews\": \"http://gplayapi.herokuapp.com/api/apps/signbank.in.gov.megscpwd/reviews\",\n            \"histogram\": {\n                \"1\": 0,\n                \"2\": 0,\n                \"3\": 2,\n                \"4\": 1,\n                \"5\": 27\n            },\n            \"price\": 0,\n            \"free\": true,\n            \"currency\": \"USD\",\n            \"priceText\": \"Free\",\n            \"available\": true,\n            \"offersIAP\": false,\n            \"size\": \"7.1M\",\n            \"androidVersion\": \"5.1\",\n            \"androidVersionText\": \"5.1 and up\",\n            \"developer\": {\n                \"devId\": \"NIC eGov Mobile Apps\",\n                \"url\": \"http://gplayapi.herokuapp.com/api/developers/NIC%20eGov%20Mobile%20Apps\"\n            },\n            \"developerId\": \"9076108670215860604\",\n            \"developerEmail\": \"candida.shadap@gmail.com\",\n            \"developerAddress\": \"NIC\",\n            \"privacyPolicy\": \"http://megscpwd.gov.in/content-terms-use.html\",\n            \"developerInternalID\": \"9076108670215860604\",\n            \"genre\": \"Tools\",\n            \"genreId\": \"TOOLS\",\n            \"icon\": \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dBJ38S43M4yLPQzCfg6V1SHAfW7o7PwBkOmStu8AlyE3H9ZMA2DJdxHujgXQ9eUgIcxZ\",\n            \"headerImage\": \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0YL8qV2sVabZiU3S4KaeVXZHuTwZl1sX1U926f8sp3Xh5guA4ZHaZHRfqoPdhYf9V00-\",\n            \"screenshots\": [\n                \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Y-YieP0nFO2lAciEhUaWZP5DmzaXtdAeQYfLCMeGFJkS5a_45RkB3iFfiLooPd2J5g\",\n                \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-U1NSMAC9ktWIDFmSS_FHNWy5fUE3xbi3aTYz4Ym0PCyHaez9em5eQPdsi_6dr7ELh4\",\n                \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/98vv0Ec9VG4a-C4MzaupkOAJdS5P6sO33dQLQQjYbiKr4z2_pLpcq_gH99G82PV8RA\",\n                \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vVXe-7_ts1lXcCwRz4yxBUwSE3zT1g5NPg8DkJ_FF_5wUH82h0aUikfQaFBnQpKHo6Q\",\n                \"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DfRnknTeKNsOvqnBr-7kxxLBoDC3Ee0_Ef5tNnDT4x-tVl62nRE4MLV8mx_rKAhfwA\"\n            ],\n            \"contentRating\": \"Everyone\",\n            \"adSupported\": false,\n            \"released\": \"Sep 24, 2018\",\n            \"updated\": 1606925093000,\n            \"version\": \"1.0.4\",\n            \"recentChanges\": \"Updating the word list with the addition of 500 words\",\n            \"comments\": [\n                \"Amazing app! very lightweight but so much information.
