CursorBot

**What can CursorBot do for me?**

CursorBot helps you modify cursors to save time, reduce error and to not break that CTRL+C/V button that we so dearly love. It allows you to enter 5 required values for modifying cursors: connectorName, groupId, service, connectorId, ticketNumber. The application then provides the following stings 
1. File name
2. Commit title
3. COmmit body
4. Branch title
5. SALAMe script
6. Modify state code block
7. Cursor Query

Please feel free to edit the application to match your own format if you preffer something different. Be sure to save a .py file of this edit.

**Where to run the script?**
- If you have Python 3 installed locally, use VS Code and simply run it from there
- If you do not, use https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/

**How to use CursorBot**
1. Paste the entire script into your choosen editor (IDE)
2. Simply change the top set of variables to the required values
3. Run the application

**Is Python 3 installed locally?**
- If you have to ask, likely not. Macbooks come with python 2.7.18 intalled out of the box
- Check by opening a terminal and running `python --version`
   - This script will not work on versions before Python 3

Check back soon for instructions on how to install Python 3 locally and how to run this application on VS Code
